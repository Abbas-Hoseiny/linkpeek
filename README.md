# 🔒 LinkPeek — Repository Status

> **This repository has been set to private as of February 2026.**

## About LinkPeek

LinkPeek is a Go-based link-preview analysis lab with Cloudflared Quick Tunnels and IP analytics, designed for security testing and preview-behavior research across messaging platforms.

**Key capabilities:**
- Link preview behavior analysis across 10+ messaging platforms
- Real-time IP & metadata logging with geolocation
- Cloudflared tunnel integration for instant HTTPS endpoints
- Automated classification of preview bots, scanners, and user clicks
- PDF/screenshot capture and browser-based agent deployment

## Why Private?

The tool is currently being used in **active security research** involving coordinated vulnerability disclosures with multiple vendors. To maintain research integrity, the source code and Docker images are temporarily restricted.

The repository will be made public again after the research findings are published.

## Docker Hub

The Docker image `hoseiny/linkpeek` is also set to private during this period.
